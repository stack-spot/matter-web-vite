The **matter-web-vite** Stack provides Templates and Plugins for starting and developing **React Web** projects.

The Stack comes prepared for the development of **`microfrontend`** applications, using the **`module federation`** from **Webpack**.

To achieve the goal of providing quick startup of microfrontend projects, the **matter-web-vite** Stack provides two main Templates:

1. The **web-react-app**, which creates a **React** application to be used alone or connected to a microfrontend environment;

2. The **web-react-appshell** template, which creates a **React shell** application that can render other applications generated by the **matter-web-vite** template.

### **Overview**

The **web-react-app** template creates a **React 17** project ready for web application development. The template is installed with the **styled-components** styling library and is prepared to be connected to a **`microfrontend shell`** that uses **`module federation`**.

This project is prepared for writing and executing unit tests using the **Jest** and **Testing Library** libraries. The project also has **`eslint`** and **`prettier`** already configured to ensure code writing standardization among developers.
