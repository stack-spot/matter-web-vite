The **matter-web-vite** Stack provides Templates and Plugins for starting and developing **React Web** projects.

The Stack comes prepared for the development of **`microfrontend`** applications, using the **`module federation`** from **Webpack**.

To achieve the goal of providing quick startup of microfrontend projects, the **matter-web-vite** Stack provides two main Templates:

1. The **web-react-app**, which creates a **React** application to be used alone or connected to a microfrontend environment;

2. The **web-react-appshell** template, which creates a **React shell** application that can render other applications generated by the **matter-web-vite** template.

Both **web-react-app** and **web-react-appshell** Templates are React applications with the **styled-components** component library and the **`routing react-router-dom`** system.

Both Templates come ready to run unit tests using the **testing-library**. In addition, they have **`eslint`** and **`prettier`** already configured to guarantee the code writing standard among developers.

The **matter-web-vite** Stack has two Plugins that can be applied to both Templates mentioned above:

1. The **`beagle`** Plugin adds to the project the dependency and the required `boilerplate` from the library for **Server Driven UI** [Beagle](https://usebeagle.io);

2. The **`deploy-aws`** Plugin adds the ability to create **AWS** and **Github Actions** resources to deploy to these resources.
